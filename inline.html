<h1>Jennifer Two 

<p>For twenty years I had no one to talk to except the computer, and the robots, and myself. The computer had no personality, the robots were mindless little drones, and I wasn't much of a conversationalist.</p>

<p>Then she showed up.</p>

<p>I must have been asleep when it happened -- the sky never got lighter or darker here, just the same starlit twilight, so I'd taken to going to bed and waking up when I felt like it.</p>

<p>I didn't feel like waking up only four hours after telling the computer to darken the windows and dim the lights. I needed a good nine hours of sleep to be functional these days. But I felt her, and she jolted me out of a dream that melted away instantly.</p>

<p>"Computer, interrogative: who's there?"</p>

<p>The androgynous voice, which had resisted two decades of me trying to reprogram it into something a little more pleasant, said, "there is another human present on the island."</p>
